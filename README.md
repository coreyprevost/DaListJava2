# DaListJava2
 Im building this app in order to alleviate not being able to keep track of my goals for the day. When this happens to me, I end up on social media and youtube, instead of what's important. Using the Android Studio Platform with Java. 
 Issue #1: Ive come across the issue of my array list not showing up on my to do list. Solution/Action : introduce an #ArrayAdapter.
 Issue #2: Top Action bar getting in the way of ListView visibility Solution/Action : Set style of app From"Dark Action Bar" to "No Action Bar"
